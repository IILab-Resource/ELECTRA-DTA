# ELECTRA-DTA

In this github repository, you will see all the source code. However, the trained data is too big. The entire trained data is here http://iilab.hit.edu.cn/dtadata/ElectraDTA/

It's best to download them in the dataset folder, otherwise, you have to specify many different paths later.
